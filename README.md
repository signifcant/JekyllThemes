# hello-world

The Hello World project is a time-honored tradition in computer programming. It is a simple exercise that gets you started when learning something new. Let’s get started with GitHub!

You’ll learn how to:

1.Create and use a repository

2.Start and manage a new branch

3.Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits

4.Open and merge a pull request


On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
